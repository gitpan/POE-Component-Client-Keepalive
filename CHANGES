    Time for a new release.

  2008-07-13 06:23:06 (r85) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Improve handling of canceled requests. Avoids DNS response errors and
    the dreaded "unexpectedly undefined requests" crash. Fix prompted by
    a test case from Jeff Bisbee.

    Release 0.1001

    Resolve an issue where this component's session could shut down
    before the object. Thanks to Kevin Scaldeferri for reporting the
    problem in rt.cpan.org ticket 27182.

    Randomize the ports used by test 08 and 51. Not a perfect solution,
    but it should avoid most bind errors on systems that don't allow
    immeditate port reuse. Works around the issue in rt.cpan.org 29097,
    reported by Andreas J. König. (Wish me luck on the Unicode there.)
