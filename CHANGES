    hippietrail on Freenode #perl reported a test failure that turns out
    to be a connection refused error rather than ETIMEDOUT. We'll skip
    the test if the connection is refused outright. Thanks to them for
    interactively trying some things out.

    Notify the tester that this may take a long time if their firewall
    blackholes connections.

    Resolve a test bug introduced by POE's new dispatch timing.

    Adam Kennedy reported that t/09_timeout.t was consistently failing
    under the latest development version of POE. It turned out to be a
    dodgy test relying on event timing, which was bound to fail sooner or
    later anyway. This commit removes the reliance on I/O event timing.

    Add an 00_info.t test to help diagnose platform- and
    dependency-specific issues.

    Use latest POE, and prepare for a new release.

    Added a machine-readable repository directory to the distribution.
    Documented the bug tracker, repository, and other resource URLs.

  Date:   Sun Jul 26 18:04:17 2009 +0000
  
    Avoid calling setsockopt() on bad file descriptors. Sometimes a
    socket is given back to POE::Component::Client::Keepalive, and then
    it goes bad before it can be reclaimed or discarded.

  commit 62ffc4f55722ee314abef97ac5aea46c9c45a383

    Set the Net::IP dependency, even though POE::Component::Client::DNS
    should pull it in via Net::DNS.

    Resolve rt.cpan.org 41326, reported by J.G.Konrad and entered into
    the queue by Chris Williams. Dotted quad detection was pretty weak,
    but now it uses Net::IP::ip_is_ipv4() to detect whether DNS
    resolution is needed.

    New version.

  Date:   Tue Dec 9 04:55:21 2008 +0000
  
    Do not bother trying to shut down cancelled requests. Attempting to
    do so only causes heartbreak and crashes when we dereference a string
    rather than an arrayref.

  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>

    ExtUtils::MakeMaker officially added META_MERGE, which we now use.

  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date:   Mon Dec 8 17:49:43 2008 +0000
  
    Resolve a memory leak uncovered by jcasey and diagnosed by Apocalypse
    in irc.perl.org #poe. Request IDs were allocated by not removed when
    done, so the hash to prevent collisions would only grow over time.

    Back out the setsockopt() call because it was causing runtime errors.
    If we must try to avoid FIN_WAIT_2, we must do it better next time.

    Applied Ivan Mitoyarov's patch to completely clean up requests that
    have been enqueued for a full pool.

    EXPERIMENTAL: Turn off SO_LINGER when closing kept-alive sockets due
    to activity while in the pool or being kept in the pool too long.

    Ignore Client::DNS responses if Client:Keepalive has shut down.
