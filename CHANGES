    Applied Martijn van Beers' patch to make Client::Keepalive never
    return the connection immediately. Rather, it always posts
    connections back, even if they can be immediately satisfied from the
    component's connection cache. This simplifies the module's general
    usage since the pattern was to post the immediately returned
    connection to a common got-a-connection handler anyway.

    Remove the component's alias during shutdown(). This immediately
    kills off the component when it's done shutting down. The component's
    immediate destruction triggers some ASSERT errors due to sloppy
    cleanup in the tests. This commit fixes the tests so they stop dying
    and some junk.

    Ah, there's no need to pass %args to a session initializer if they
    aren't being used there anyway.

    Remove some parameters we're not using. This eliminates all use of
    HEAP in the code. Looks like object-based sessions are more powerful
    than I originally thought.

    Well, technically, it doesn't need all these funky prerequisites.
    They're holdovers from when this Makefile.PL belonged to
    POE::Component::Client::HTTP.

  2004-10-03 16:58:01 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.3

    "make dist" added META.yml to the MANIFEST, so let's commit that. The
    META.yml file is not included since it's generated during "make
    dist". 

  2004-10-03 16:55:39 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.2; Makefile.PL 1.2

    CHANGES should be dynamically generated. Removed that. Mix in the
    code to generate CHANGES during "make dist". And cvr.perl moved, so
    reflect that in the MANIFEST.
