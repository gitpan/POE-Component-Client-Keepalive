  2006-09-26 17:57:54 (r73) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump version to 0.0901 to work around a PAUSE mishap. 

=========================
2006-09-26 17:45:57 v0_09
=========================

  2006-09-26 17:45:14 (r71) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    New release - 0.09. 

  2006-09-25 10:23:24 (r70) by joel; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    fixed connection manager deallocate() method to deallocate a
    connection cleanly whether or not it is connected

  2006-09-23 23:11:23 (r69) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Register an event handler I forgot when making the previous commit. 

  2006-09-23 23:09:29 (r68) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Apply a heavily modified version of Joel Bernstein's patch to allow
    pending connection requests to be canceled. He probably won't
    recognize most of the code. 

===========================
2006-05-21 20:57:19 v0_0801
===========================

  2006-05-21 20:57:06 (r66) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump the version for release. 

  2006-05-21 20:56:44 (r65) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Replace asynchronous events from command methods with call(), so that
    internal structures can be altered synchronously. This eliminates a
    lot of race conditions, and it may become standard for the proxy
    object pattern.
    
    Improve shutdown() greatly. Cascade shutdown to the embedded DNS
    component. Clean up extra references, and generally make this work. 

  2006-05-21 20:54:23 (r64) by rcaputo; t/02_socket_queue.t M

    Don't check against literal "connection refused". Rather, check
    against the stringified version of $! = ECONNREFUSED. This should be
    much more portable. 

  2006-05-21 00:39:16 (r63) by rcaputo; MANIFEST M

    Remove META.yml. It's generated during "make dist". 

=========================
2006-05-21 00:35:41 v0_08
=========================

  2006-05-21 00:35:30 (r61) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump up the version for release. 

  2006-05-10 20:42:27 (r60) by woggle
  t/13_close.t A; MANIFEST M; Conn-Keepalive.pm M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Add close() method to Conn-Keepalive so that sockets can be closed
    prematurely (and so we can avoid reusing sockets that are still
    recieving a response we are not interested as if they were idle).
    Bump up version number so PoCoCliHTTP can depend on this
    functionality. Add test case for it.
    
    Also check for select() failing (e.g. 'bad file descriptor') in
    Client-Keepalive's check of socket readiness instead of silently
    trying to sysread() in that case. 

  2006-05-09 06:14:16 (r59) by woggle; MANIFEST M

    Oops, forgot to update the MANIFEST. 

  2006-05-09 06:11:06 (r58) by woggle
  t/51_reiss_reuse.t A; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Fix bug and add test case for bug where a socket would be reused and
    then free'd by _ka_wake_up when we were at the connection limit.

===========================

  2006-03-29 18:31:18 (r56) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    $VERSION += 0.0001. 

  2006-03-29 18:29:49 (r55) by rcaputo; t/02_socket_queue.t M

    ActivePerl knows ECONNREFUSED by its other popular name, "unknown
    error". 

  2006-03-29 16:09:44 (r54) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    ExtUtils::MakeMaker's version is a STRING! A STRING! 

===========================
2006-03-29 15:27:27 v0_0702
===========================

  2006-03-29 15:26:30 (r52) by rcaputo; t/02_socket_queue.t M

    The "connection refused" message seems to vary between Unixy systems
    and Windows (what a surprise!). Make the comparison case and
    whitespace insensitive, and display the actual value in the test
    report. Future failures will tell me what the test should be looking
    for. 

  2006-03-29 15:22:43 (r51) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Make the EXTRA_META parameters to ExtUtils::MakeMaker contingent upon
    the presence of a sufficient version of that module. 

  2006-03-29 15:22:01 (r50) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Set version for release. 

  2006-03-25 20:25:56 (r49) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Perhaps fix the no_index YAML. We'll see if TestServer.pm is indexed
    in the next release.

  Makefile.PL M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Try ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.30_01's EXTRA_META feature to stop people
    from indexing the mylib directory. Damn them. Also, bump up the
    version for a new release. 

  2006-03-24 13:58:40 (r46) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Fix a problem where connection error messages were not propagated
    back to the user. I was using $@ rather than $! in one place. D'oh!
    Also fixed some tab damage while I was here. 

=========================
2006-03-24 02:46:37 v0_07
=========================

  2006-03-24 02:45:46 (r44) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump up the version for release.

  .releaserc M; t/09_timeout.t M; t/12_extref.t A; MANIFEST M;
  Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Set extra references on sessions that use Client::Keepalive, so they
    can stick around until connections are completed. What they do after
    that is their business. :) Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #7889.
    
    Also triggered the ASSERT errors from rt.cpan.org ticket #7890. Added
    the SF_SHUTDOWN flag like that ticket suggested, resolving it. 

=========================

  2005-12-09 05:50:54 (r41) by rcaputo
  .releaserc A; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Add a .releaserc for Module::Release, and bump up the version. 

  2005-09-17 18:26:46 (r40) by rcaputo
  Makefile.PL M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Apply a semi-anonymous guest patch to make POE::Component::SSLify an
    optional dependancy. It defers errors regarding missing SSL support
    to runtime. This resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 14253.
