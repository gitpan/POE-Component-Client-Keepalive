    [rt.cpan.org 76776] Fix an edge case where queued requests don't
    start.

    Sergei Kozunov came through with another great ticket. If two
    requests for the same host arrive, and the first one fails, the
    second one will time out in the queue. But only if no other requests
    are already pending. This change wakes up the queue when a connection
    fails, causing the subsequent request to be processed.

    [rt.cpan.org 76540] Add stubs for non-blocking SSL.

    POE::Component::SSLify is non-blocking now. Add (and comment out)
    alpha-quality support for this feature. It needs work, and I hope
    someone who knows it better can help.

    [rt.cpan.org 76987] Cancel timed-out PoCo::Resolver requests.

    Sergei Kozunov pointed out that POE::Component::Resolver requests
    aren't canceled when POE::Component::Client::HTTP requests time out
    during DNS resolution. Cancel those requests!

    Apply Markus Jansen's patch to add a TCP protocol resolver hint.

    Markus reports that this resolves rampant errors on solaris systems.
    I've verified that it doesn't break tests, which is bonus! Thanks!

    Need the absolutely latest POE::Component::Resolver as of this
    writing.

    [rt.cpan.org 73353] Use ports instead of schemes when resolving
    hosts.

    Solaris (and probably other systems) don't have an /etc/services
    entry for http, so relying on the lookup fails here. Luckily the user
    also provides a port (which may or may not be symbolic). I'll use
    that for now and see where it gets me.

    Thank you, Michael Lackhoff, for reporting this bug.

    Use Net::IP::Minimal instead of Net::IP

    Use Net::IP::Minimal instead of Net::IP

    Net::IP consumes a fair chunk of memory, Net::DNS stopped using it

    Multi-line NAME sections corrupt the VERSION/NAME section ordering.
    I'm not sure why or which plugin is doing it, but making the NAME
    test one line is a serviceable workaround.

    Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 69235, reported by Debian developer
    Gregor Hermann.
