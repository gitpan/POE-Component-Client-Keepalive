    hippietrail on Freenode #perl reported a test failure that turns out
    to be a connection refused error rather than ETIMEDOUT. We'll skip
    the test if the connection is refused outright. Thanks to them for
    interactively trying some things out.

    Notify the tester that this may take a long time if their firewall
    blackholes connections.

  commit 1658afd15631d9ace4f1db98523ef84da3724f29

    Resolve a test bug introduced by POE's new dispatch timing.

    Adam Kennedy reported that t/09_timeout.t was consistently failing
    under the latest development version of POE. It turned out to be a
    dodgy test relying on event timing, which was bound to fail sooner or
    later anyway. This commit removes the reliance on I/O event timing.

    Add an 00_info.t test to help diagnose platform- and
    dependency-specific issues.

    Avoid calling setsockopt() on bad file descriptors. Sometimes a
    socket is given back to POE::Component::Client::Keepalive, and then
    it goes bad before it can be reclaimed or discarded.

    Set the Net::IP dependency, even though POE::Component::Client::DNS
    should pull it in via Net::DNS.

    Resolve rt.cpan.org 41326, reported by J.G.Konrad and entered into
    the queue by Chris Williams. Dotted quad detection was pretty weak,
    but now it uses Net::IP::ip_is_ipv4() to detect whether DNS
    resolution is needed.
