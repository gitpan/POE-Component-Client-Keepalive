    rt.cpan.org 92985. Ideally resolve "Not an ARRAY reference" at
    shutdown.

    I haven't encountered the problem myself, but I see where it could
    happen, thanks to the bug report. This change should fix it, but I
    haven't got a test case, so no absolute guarantees are made.

    Improve thread safety.

    Move away from using stringified references. The references can
    change when threads come into play, but the saved string versions
    won't. This includes using fork() on Windows.

    Log why connection tests fail.

    Most cpantesters.org failure reports are of the form "connection
    failed" without explaining why. Explain why.

    Resolve most bind() conflicts by using port 0.

    I was using random ports, which are mostly okay, but over the course
    of hundreds of cpantesters.org reports, enough showed up to make it a
    concern

    Remove a TestServer shutdown race condition.

    Counted after 14 cpantesters.org failures of the form "Failed test
    'first request honored asynchronously'". Added detailed error
    information to the failure. If it happens again, I'll be better
    prepared to fix it.

    Stopped relying on the order of first/second connection callbacks.
    Previously, if the second fired first, we'd shut down the TestServer
    too early. The first connection would then fail because.

    Meanwhile, always shutdown the connection manager (not just after the
    second response). Each session has its own, and they both need to go.
    Otherwise the program waits the obligatory connection pool timeout.
