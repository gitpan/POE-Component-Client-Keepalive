  2006-05-21 00:35:30 (r61) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump up the version for release. 

  2006-05-10 20:42:27 (r60) by woggle
  t/13_close.t A; MANIFEST M; Conn-Keepalive.pm M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Add close() method to Conn-Keepalive so that sockets can be closed
    prematurely (and so we can avoid reusing sockets that are still
    recieving a response we are not interested as if they were idle).
    Bump up version number so PoCoCliHTTP can depend on this
    functionality. Add test case for it.
    
    Also check for select() failing (e.g. 'bad file descriptor') in
    Client-Keepalive's check of socket readiness instead of silently
    trying to sysread() in that case. 

  2006-05-09 06:14:16 (r59) by woggle; MANIFEST M

    Oops, forgot to update the MANIFEST. 

  2006-05-09 06:11:06 (r58) by woggle
  t/51_reiss_reuse.t A; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Fix bug and add test case for bug where a socket would be reused and
    then free'd by _ka_wake_up when we were at the connection limit.

  2006-03-29 18:31:18 (r56) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    $VERSION += 0.0001. 

  2006-03-29 18:29:49 (r55) by rcaputo; t/02_socket_queue.t M

    ActivePerl knows ECONNREFUSED by its other popular name, "unknown
    error". 

  2006-03-29 16:09:44 (r54) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    ExtUtils::MakeMaker's version is a STRING! A STRING!

===========================

  2006-03-29 15:26:30 (r52) by rcaputo; t/02_socket_queue.t M

    The "connection refused" message seems to vary between Unixy systems
    and Windows (what a surprise!). Make the comparison case and
    whitespace insensitive, and display the actual value in the test
    report. Future failures will tell me what the test should be looking
    for. 

  2006-03-29 15:22:43 (r51) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Make the EXTRA_META parameters to ExtUtils::MakeMaker contingent upon
    the presence of a sufficient version of that module. 

  2006-03-29 15:22:01 (r50) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Set version for release. 

  2006-03-25 20:25:56 (r49) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Perhaps fix the no_index YAML. We'll see if TestServer.pm is indexed
    in the next release.

  Makefile.PL M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Try ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.30_01's EXTRA_META feature to stop people
    from indexing the mylib directory. Damn them. Also, bump up the
    version for a new release. 

  2006-03-24 13:58:40 (r46) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Fix a problem where connection error messages were not propagated
    back to the user. I was using $@ rather than $! in one place. D'oh!
    Also fixed some tab damage while I was here.

  2006-03-24 02:45:46 (r44) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

  .releaserc M; t/09_timeout.t M; t/12_extref.t A; MANIFEST M;
  Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Set extra references on sessions that use Client::Keepalive, so they
    can stick around until connections are completed. What they do after
    that is their business. :) Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #7889.
    
    Also triggered the ASSERT errors from rt.cpan.org ticket #7890. Added
    the SF_SHUTDOWN flag like that ticket suggested, resolving it.

  .releaserc A; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Add a .releaserc for Module::Release, and bump up the version. 

  2005-09-17 18:26:46 (r40) by rcaputo
  Makefile.PL M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Apply a semi-anonymous guest patch to make POE::Component::SSLify an
    optional dependancy. It defers errors regarding missing SSL support
    to runtime. This resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 14253.

=========================

  2005-09-13 15:51:04 (r38) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Now we are 0.05! 

  2005-09-04 18:56:42 (r37) by rcaputo
  t/04_free_each.t M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    The code to reclaim freed sockets tests to see whether the freed
    socket is still usable. It did not check whether the socket was
    actually open! This patch adds that check, hopefully robustifying the
    code a little. 

=========================

=========================

  2005-07-29 16:02:02 (r35) by rcaputo
  Makefile.PL M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump the version for release, and increase the version of the
    Client::DNS dependency to "the latest". 

  2005-07-29 15:54:39 (r34) by rcaputo; t/50_bisbee_timeout.t A

    I forgot to add Jeff Bisbee's regression test. Aaaaaugh! 

  2005-07-28 05:57:46 (r33) by rcaputo
  t/01_socket_reuse.t M; MANIFEST M; t/03_each_queue.t M;
  Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Jeff Bisbee discovered that Client::Keepalive may return multiple
    responses for a single request. This causes bizarre behavior (usually
    crashes) in the likes of POE::Component::Client::HTTP. This commit
    adds a regression test for the issue and patches Client::Keepalive to
    avoid redundant responses. 

  2005-07-25 18:50:37 (r32) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Replace tabs with an appropriate number of spaces. At some point
    we'll need to just go with tabs-indent; spaces-align behavior. 

  2005-06-23 02:13:42 (r31) by rcaputo; README M

    Update the README for the new documentation. TODO: Automate this for
    distributions where the README is merely the main module's perldoc
    directed to a text file.

  2005-06-23 01:04:12 (r29) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Oops! Something wasn't indented properly! Gasp! 

  2005-06-22 14:40:07 (r28) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump up the version to 0.03 for release. Also destroy tabs in the
    file. 

  2005-06-21 17:36:19 (r27) by rcaputo; Conn-Keepalive.pm M

    Fix $VERSION to work with Subversion. 

  2005-06-21 15:14:28 (r26) by rcaputo; MANIFEST M; Makefile.PL M

    Remove META.yml from MANIFEST. It appears to be auto-generated into
    the distribution at "make dist" time. Replace cvs-log.perl with
    svn-log.perl in Makefile.PL since we're in Subversion now. 

  2005-05-06 16:18:30 (r25) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Depend on POE 0.31, and add POE::Component::SSLify as a dependency.

    r5553@fangorn: martijn | 2005-05-06 17:59:52 +0200 Fix for the
    connection being closed on the server side, but not waiting for the
    EOF on the client side if the connection is closed before the
    Connection object is released. We don't reuse the socket in that case
    anymore. Now to try to find a way to do the same if the connection
    closing happens after the Connection object goes away. In this case,
    the socket may have already been reused, so the new client still gets
    an EOF 'error' as the first event, and nothing else.

  2005-05-05 05:25:51 (r16) by rcaputo; mylib/TestServer.pm M

    Add a shutdown_clients() method so tests can shutdown all the clients
    at once. Also make the server more robust against race conditions by
    not calling put() on a disconnected client. 

  2005-05-05 05:24:45 (r15) by rcaputo; Conn-Keepalive.pm M

    Destroy the connection object's wheel before freeing the underlying
    socket. Otherwise there's overlap between it and the keepalive pool
    while they both have select_read() on the socket.
