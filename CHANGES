    "make dist" added META.yml to the MANIFEST, so let's commit that. The
    META.yml file is not included since it's generated during "make
    dist".

    CHANGES should be dynamically generated. Removed that. Mix in the
    code to generate CHANGES during "make dist". And cvr.perl moved, so
    reflect that in the MANIFEST.
