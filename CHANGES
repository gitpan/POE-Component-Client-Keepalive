  2009-07-28 06:06:04 (r111) by rcaputo
  Makefile.PL M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Use latest POE, and prepare for a new release.

  2009-07-27 04:55:14 (r110) by rcaputo
  Makefile.PL M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Added a machine-readable repository directory to the distribution.
    Documented the bug tracker, repository, and other resource URLs. 

  2009-07-27 02:39:01 (r109) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Set license and repository metadata.

  2009-07-26 18:04:17 (r108) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Avoid calling setsockopt() on bad file descriptors. Sometimes a
    socket is given back to POE::Component::Client::Keepalive, and then
    it goes bad before it can be reclaimed or discarded. 

  2009-07-26 07:09:17 (r107) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Set the Net::IP dependency, even though POE::Component::Client::DNS
    should pull it in via Net::DNS.

  2009-07-26 07:08:00 (r106) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org 41326, reported by J.G.Konrad and entered into
    the queue by Chris Williams. Dotted quad detection was pretty weak,
    but now it uses Net::IP::ip_is_ipv4() to detect whether DNS
    resolution is needed.

=================================

  2008-12-09 06:14:33 (r104) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    New version.

  2008-12-09 04:55:21 (r103) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Do not bother trying to shut down cancelled requests. Attempting to
    do so only causes heartbreak and crashes when we dereference a string
    rather than an arrayref.

  2008-12-08 18:07:54 (r102) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    ExtUtils::MakeMaker officially added META_MERGE, which we now use. 

  2008-12-08 17:49:43 (r101) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Resolve a memory leak uncovered by jcasey and diagnosed by Apocalypse
    in irc.perl.org #poe. Request IDs were allocated by not removed when
    done, so the hash to prevent collisions would only grow over time.

=================================

  2008-12-07 03:52:29 (r99) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Back out the setsockopt() call because it was causing runtime errors.
    If we must try to avoid FIN_WAIT_2, we must do it better next time.

  2008-11-30 19:04:51 (r98) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Applied Ivan Mitoyarov's patch to completely clean up requests that
    have been enqueued for a full pool. 

=================================

=================================

  2008-11-24 22:36:21 (r96) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump again for release.

  2008-11-24 22:35:43 (r95) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Don't bother with setsockopt() on filehandles that aren't open. 

=================================
2008-11-24T22:30:36.636504Z v0_22
=================================

  2008-11-24 22:28:47 (r93) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Rely on modern Client::DNS.

  t/12_extref.t M; t/50_bisbee_timeout.t M; t/08_quick_reuse.t M;
  t/11_dead_socket.t M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Bump up the version, and fix some tab damage.

  2008-11-24 20:12:23 (r91) by rcaputo
  t/06_activity.t M; t/04_free_each.t M; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    EXPERIMENTAL: Turn off SO_LINGER when closing kept-alive sockets due
    to activity while in the pool or being kept in the pool too long. 

  2008-11-21 17:52:56 (r90) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Ignore Client::DNS responses if Client:Keepalive has shut down.

=================================

  2008-08-06 19:01:16 (r88) by rcaputo; Client-Keepalive.pm M

    Reverse the sense of the dotted-quad address test. Resolves
    rt.cpan.org ticket 38219, reported by Apocalypse.
