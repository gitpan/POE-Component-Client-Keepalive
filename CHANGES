    Multi-line NAME sections corrupt the VERSION/NAME section ordering.
    I'm not sure why or which plugin is doing it, but making the NAME
    test one line is a serviceable workaround.

    Gregor Hermann.

    Use only a single POE::Component::Resolver by default. Prevents a lot
    of POE::Component::Client::HTTP useragents from consuming all file
    descriptors. Reported by Karen_m and BinGOs on Freenode #perl, and
    fixed with the help of Karen's test case.
